                    Welcome to Cookify, your go-to space for saving, sharing, and discovering delicious recipes from around the world. Created by a passionate Latina cook who was raised in the heart of the kitchen, where the smells of Puerto Rican and Salvadorian dishes filled the air, this website is all about celebrating food, family, and culture.

                <p>
                    As someone who was taught to cook by my mom, aunts, and grandma, I've come to understand that cooking is not just about following a recipeâ€”it's about love, tradition, and sharing those flavors with others. It's my mission to offer a place where you can create, save, and enjoy recipes that reflect the rich variety of cuisines I grew up with and beyond. Whether you're looking for the perfect Puerto Rican mofongo, a comforting Salvadorian pupusa, or a refreshing drink to pair with your meal, Cookify has something for everyone.
